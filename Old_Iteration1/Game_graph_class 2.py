# ======================= Overview ======================= #
# % ------------ Class GameGraph ------------ % #
# This class makes an abstraction of the gridworld class
# A node in the graph is: n1 = ([l_p1, l_p2, ...], pa), where l_pi is the location of player i in the grid and pa is the agent that is active in the current node
# + state: Returns the state of the game as a function of individual locations of players in the game graph
# + state2node: Returns the locations of the environment and system based on the state input into the graph
# + edges: A function that returns the edges of the game graph. it sets edges from transitions of the agents on the grid. If the transitions of an agent are independent of other agents on the grid, 
#  then the bridge variable is empty. If bridge is non-empty, and if the agent transitions to one of the bridge locations, it must stay there until the system is closer to all (or any) of the other bridges than the environment is
# + shortest_distance(bridge, start): Returns a list of shortest distances from the start point to every element in bridge.
# + setup_dict(): Sets up a dictionary to convert environment locations on the grid to a composed state in the range (1,Ne). Similarly, it composes all system locations on the grid into a composed state in the range (0,Ns).
# + Also returns a list pEdges of length Ne (Ns) where each element of the list points to other possible transitions. So pEdges[3] returns the possible transitions of the collective environment from state 3.
